# Image-classification-CIFAR10-using-theano-on-cpu

this whole project is worked on anaconda2 (any version) for python 2.7
https://www.continuum.io/downloads
any OS whatever you choose

step 1: downlaod dataset library for python, the link is:

  1. numpy
  2. theano
  3. PIL(pillow)
  4. lasagne
  5. glob
  6. pickle
  
step 3: follow isntruction in code
 specially changing path for datatset and weights file(model.npz)

Note: it will take time around many hours so have patience.

And TA DA after some passing hours you will get trained network and it will also give you prediction on any image
